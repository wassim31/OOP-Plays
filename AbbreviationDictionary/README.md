Create a class Abbreviations for managing common abbreviations. The class must have a constructor, which does not take any parameters. The class must also provide the following methods:

public void addAbbreviation(String abbreviation, String explanation) adds a new abbreviation and its explanation.

public boolean hasAbbreviation(String abbreviation) checks if an abbreviation has already been added; returns true if it has and false if it has not.

public String findExplanationFor(String abbreviation) finds the explanation for an abbreviation; returns null if the abbreviation has not been added yet.
